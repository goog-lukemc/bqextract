# BQ Extract
:exclamation: bqextract is pre-alpha software

This repo provides a working prototype that can be use to extract data to a cloud stroage button from BQ in CSV format.
It is intended to be used as code samples for Go BQ SDK and GCS signed URLs. You will need to provide your own PEM secret
to sign the urls.
